## Rev.G

- removed crystal from FT812
- removed MCU_IO4 connection from RP2040
- the MCU_IO4 line now repurposed as FT812 8MHz clk generated by FPGA
- disconnected FT_AUDIO, FT_DISPLAY from FPGA
- PWM audio replaced with UDA1334 DAC
- disconnected FT_PD from FPGA, connected to RP2040 as FT_RESET
- disconnected MIDI_CLK from FPGA, replaced with 12 MHz crystal
- disconnected MIDI_RST from FPGA, connected to RP2040
- disconnected ESP_BOOT and ESP_RESET from FPGA
- connected ESP_RESET to RP2040
- connected FT812 GPIO0 and GPIO1 and FT SPI to the uBUS header
- connected free FPGA pins to the uBUS as I2S slave pins
- added optional diode to the HDMI 5V line
- rerouted MCU_SCK, ADC_BCK and FT_CLK to the FPGA globak clock pins

Warning: Due to so many backward incompatible changes in the Rev.G, a dedicated firmware (\_g.uf2) and cores (.kg3) will be released for this revision.
Do not try to install the default firmware and cores (kg2) on this revision!
